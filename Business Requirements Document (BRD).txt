Project Title

Wine Market Segmentation using PCA & Unsupervised Learning



1. Business Problem Statement

The global wine industry faces increasing complexity due to diverse product portfolios, evolving consumer preferences, and competitive pricing pressures. Traditional segmentation approaches based on region or price bands fail to capture the chemical and sensory diversity of wines, leading to:

Inefficient product positioning

Poor customer targeting

Limited insight into premium vs mass-market differentiation

Business stakeholders require a data-driven segmentation framework that groups wines based on intrinsic chemical characteristics rather than superficial attributes.



2. Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this initiative are:

Identify natural wine segments based on chemical composition

Enable data-backed product categorization for marketing and pricing

Reduce dimensional complexity while retaining meaningful variance

Provide interpretable and actionable clusters for business users

Deliver insights through a deployable, interactive BI application



3. Key Business Questions

Can wines be segmented into distinct, meaningful groups using chemical properties alone?

Which wine segments represent premium, balanced, or light profiles?

How does dimensionality reduction improve clarity and decision-making?

Can clustering results be operationalized via a self-service analytics tool?



4. Scope of Work
In Scope

Exploratory data analysis of wine chemical attributes

Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Unsupervised segmentation using K-Means clustering

Quantitative validation using Silhouette Score & Davies–Bouldin Index

Deployment via Streamlit for business consumption

Out of Scope

Supervised quality prediction

External pricing or customer demographic data

Sensory panel or textual review analysis




5. Success Metrics (Business KPIs)
KPI	Business Relevance
Cluster Separation	Indicates distinct product segments
Cluster Compactness	Ensures internal consistency
Variance Retained	Preserves decision-relevant information
Interpretability	Enables stakeholder adoption
Deployment Readiness	Supports real-world usage
6. Stakeholders

Product Managers – portfolio rationalization

Marketing Teams – targeted campaigns

Sales Strategy – premium vs value segmentation

Data & BI Teams – analytics enablement



7. Constraints & Assumptions

Chemical composition is assumed to be a reliable proxy for wine style

Clusters are descriptive, not prescriptive

PCA introduces controlled information loss in exchange for clarity



8. Expected Business Value

Improved product differentiation

Stronger data storytelling for stakeholders

Foundation for advanced analytics (pricing, recommendation engines)
